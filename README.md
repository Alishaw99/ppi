# <center> Policy Priority Inference </center>

This is the official repository of the Policy Priority Inference (PPI) research programme, created by <a href="https://oguerr.com">Dr. Omar A. Guerrero</a>  and <a href="https://www.social-complexity.com">Prof. Gonzalo Castañeda</a>.
Here you will find the source code of the latest version of the agent-computing model underlying PPI, as well as tutorials to get started.
These tutorials assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python, and that you are familiar with the libraries Numpy and Pandas.
