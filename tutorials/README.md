# PPI Tutorials

These tutorials assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python, and that you are familiar with the libraries Numpy and Pandas.
There are two main ways to run them.

## Local run

Download the `tutorials` folder in your local machine.
Then, open the Jupyter notebooks and you are good to go.

## Cloud run (Google Colab)

Open a cloud computer and open the tutorial of interest by providing the link to the GitHub repository.
After the Jupyter notebook is open, you need to upload the `clean_data` folder to your cloud computer.
Once the folder and its files have been copied, you are good to go.
