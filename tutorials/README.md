# PPI Tutorials

These tutorials assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python, and that you are familiar with the libraries Numpy and Pandas and their data structures (arrays and DataFrames).
They are numbered in progressive order to take you from the data pre-processing steps, all the way to calibrating the model parameters and performing simulation experiments to detect structural bottlenecks.
More tutorials will be added on demand.
There are two main ways to run them.

## Local run

Download the `tutorials` folder in your local machine.
Then, open the Jupyter notebooks and you are good to go.

## Cloud run (Google Colab)

Open a cloud computer and open the tutorial of interest by providing the link to the GitHub repository.
After the Jupyter notebook is open, you need to upload the `clean_data` folder to your cloud computer.
Once the folder and its files have been copied, you are good to go.
